A constructor ca be written without the classname, but with new instead:

    <modifier> new(...)
    {
        ...
    }



Only for constructors, if a parameter (variable in the brackets after new/the classname)
is named, for example xyz, and there is an instance variable with same name,

    xyz =;        // =; must not have any spaces

is allowed and compiles to

    this.xyz = xyz;


If the same applies to x, y and z

    this.\{x,y,z} =;        // bracket mismatch in emacs

is allowed and compiles to

    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.z = z;
