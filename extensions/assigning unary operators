All unary operators (does not inclide prefix and postfix (++x, --x, x++, x--])
can be made assigning by adding a bang in the after the variable:

    !x!       compiles to     x = !x
    
    ~x!       compiles to     x = ~x
    
    -x!       compiles to     x = -x
    
    +x!       compiles to     x = +x      ; no, +x does not make sense, but for
                                          ; reasones beyond my comprehension, it does exist
                                        
    <>x!      compiles to     x = <>x     ; new operator
    
    <!>x!     compiles to     x = <!>x    ; new operator
