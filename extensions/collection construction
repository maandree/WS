When an object is created, { } can be used in a similary fashion to
when used on array constructions. But for clarity nested use is not
allowed!

After { } you may add ( ) with constructor parameters. And in the end
you can add -> followed by a method name to specify which method to
use to insert items; 'add' is default for singleelement insertions,
and 'put' is default for multielement insertions.
To create a multielement insertion, seperate the elements with ->
in the same order as specified in the insertion method.
