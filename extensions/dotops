In mathematical syntax

   x < y < z

checks x < y and y < z, in Java this would check x < y, and
the compare the returning boolean to z.

The allow syntax like this .-operations are added, by prepending
a slash the mathematical syntax is used.

   a .< b .> c .== d .!= e .<= f .>= g

compiles to

   (a < b) && (b < c) && (c == d) && (d == e)
   && (e != f) && (f <= g) && (g >= g)

Any relational or equality operaion may have a dot before it.
