A prototype method are only allowed in abstract classes.
By adding 'prototype' instead of 'abstract' in a method head
you make the method callable form subclasses, it is as no
instructions. It must however still be overridden.
If a method has 'prototype' you can add instructions to it
just like a non-abstract method, and just for the subclass
to override it or be abstract.
