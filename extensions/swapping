x <--> y                    swaps x and y
x >--> y >--> z <--> w      swaps x to y, y to z, z to w, and w to x
x <--< y <--< z <--> w      swaps w to z, z to y, y to x, and x to w

>--> and <--< is used to indicate replacement direction, and <--> is
added the end to indicate circular swapping, and is required.

for x <--> y, that is two variable swapping,
the C code

    *x ^= *y; *y ^= *x; *x ^= *y;

should be the best way to swap, but only if *x â‰  *y,
so classical swapping with temporary variable is the
best way.
