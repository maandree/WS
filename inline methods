By adding 'inline' in a method you tell the compiler to
evaluate the method inplace of the method call.

If you do not use 'public', 'protected' or 'saved' on the
method is not included in the bytecode. Storing it in the
bytecode premits call through reflection and so other programs
to use the method (inline or not inline).

'saved' is added directly infront if 'inline', with seperating
whitespace.
