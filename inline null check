x?.y.z? ?? n

returns x.y.z, but iff x or z is null,
then n is returned.


x?.y.z? ?? null

is similar to not using ??.


If you want to return something else iff
null check passed (rather than failed),
you can use

x?.y.z? somethingElse ?? null

you can combine this:

x?.y.z? somethingElse ?? n


If you want an ? on everything (all variables,
root and dereferenced) you can use ??? instead
of ??.
