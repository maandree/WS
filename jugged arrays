Instead of [][] for a twodimension array, [,] can be used.
The difference is that [,] (jugged array) is converted to
a large one-dimension array and all dimension must be specified.

The following is not possible with jugged array, but is
with nested arrays (used here):

        int[][] triangle = new int[10][];
        for (int i = 0, k = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
	     triangle[i] = new int[i];
	     for (int j = 0; j < i; j++)
	         triangle[i][j] = k++;
        }
