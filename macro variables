Prepending the keyword 'macro' to a declaration will cause the value to
be evaluated when the values is requested. Assignment on such a variable
will override the macro. This facilities is only allowed directly inside
methods, that is, on local declarations.

macro int n = list.size();
//n == 5
list.add(null);
//n == 6
n = list.size() / 2; //or  n /= 2;
//n == 3
