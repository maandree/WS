A method may have multiple return values.
If a method should return A and B, the method
head looks like:

     public [A, B] methodName()

To return two values type:

     return [a, b];


This notation is ONLY allowed for returned.
[a, b] = [b, a] for swapping a and b is NOT allowed.

The the method doc, just add multplie @return.


The return type is converted into a class. (Best compatibility with Java.)
