By adding 'nullton' to a class head, you forbid it to have constructors.
'nullton' creates as private constructor that throws an Error.
Compilers do not accept calls to this constructor. By forbind contruction
you also IMPLY static on elements.


By adding 'singleton' to a class head, you apply a Singleton implemention
to the class, it will have a public method 'getInstance()' for getting
the only instance, this is however only for Java compatability. WS code
must use 'SingletonClass.this' or 'new SingletonClass()'.


By adding 'multiton<...>' to a class head, you apply a multikeyed
Multiton implemention to the class that is used in the same way as
'singleton'. Inside the < > after 'multiton' you specified the key
types; you must use one or more keys.
