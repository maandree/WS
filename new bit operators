<>x       returns x with reverse bit order
<!>x      returns x with reverse byte order

x <<< y   shifts x to higher bit order y steps, and fills in with ones iff the lowest bit is a one.

x <<<< y  rotates x to higher bit order y steps, that shift and fills in with overflowed bits.
x >>>> y  rotates x to lower bit order y steps, that shift and fills in with overflowed bits.

x <<<= y   compiles to  x = x <<< y;
x <<<<= y  compiles to  x = x <<<< y;
x >>>>= y  compiles to  x = x >>>> y;

The new unary postfix operator (not assigning):

    x:?     compiles to     x ? 1 : 0
