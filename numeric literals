Underscores (_) and blankspaces ( ) may be added between the digits
in numerals, but after the last digit underscore is not allowed. An
underscore before the first will cause the word to be a name rather
than a literal. Underscore and spaces may neither be added before
the prependices:

            BASE:             ALLOWED TYPE APPENDIX
    0x      Hexadecimal       s, S, l, L
    0b      Binary            b, B, s, S, l, L
    0o      Octal             b, B, s, S, l, L
    0       Octal             b, B, s, S, l, L
    0z	    (se below)        (none)
    (none)  Decimal           b, B, s, S, l, L

If the prependix 0z is used, an integer appendix between 2 and 36
inclusively must be added. The appendix may have leading zeroes and is
written in subscript, that is using ₀₁₂₃₄₅₆₇₈₉ rather than 0123456789.

A type appendix may be added; s and S stands for short, l and L stands for
long, and b and B stands for byte, int is default.

For other integers than just a zero, optionally with a type appendix,
any non-negative integer may be added in superscript (⁰¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹), to
raise the value to a power.


Float numbers may use neither of the appendices nor the prependices,
but the type appendices f and F (for float, which is default) and d and D
(for double) may be used.

The underscore rules still applies around the dots in floats.
An additional dot is allowed to create recurring decimals.
