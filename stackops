Non-assigning operators can be stacked. Lists operators,
encapsulated inside round brackets; the operator will than
be used in reverse order. The stack must be of at least
length 2.

x (^)(<<<<) y    ===    x ^ (x <<<< y)

The stacked operation can be assigning by appending an
equals sign upclose to the bracket:

x (^)(<<<<)= y     ===    x = x ^ (x <<<< y)
      or
x (^) (<<<<)= y
    but not
x (^)(<<<<) = y
