Void methods may be called in a chain, of any lenght.

'a() &> b()' calls 'a()' and iff no 'Throwable' was thrown,
'b()' is invoked. If, however, a 'Throwable' was thrown, nothing
more happens and the error is lost.

'a() |> b()' calls 'a()' and iff a 'Throwable' was thrown,
'b()' is invoked. If, however, a 'Throwable' was not thrown,
nothing more happens and the error is lost.

'a() ?> b() : c()' combines 'a() &> b()' and 'a() |> c()'.
