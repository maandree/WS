THIS MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE USING JVM, AND WOULD REQUIRE FOREIGN CODE


new T[n]? creates an one-dimensional array of lenght n and type T.
The addendum ? tells the machine to set all elements to 0.
new T[n][n] as time complexity 𝓞(n²), while new T[n][n]? ideally
have time complexity 𝓞(1). Due to security reasons, kernels,
initialises (sets everything to zeroes) memory space that is used
for the first time by a program instanse. Therefore T[n][n]?
have time complexity 𝓞(n²) but can be faster, and would have time
complexity 𝓞(1) if the used kernel did not initialise memory.
