The relational comparsion operators, that is,
<, >, <= and >=, and any derivative, may have
an up-close + before the operator, to make ut
unsigned.

a +< b  performed a < b, but handles a and b
as unsigned, instead of signed. This as no
effect on char, and is only allowed for
char, byte, short, int and long, not for
float and double. However it suffices that
only one of the variables is of those types.
+>, +<= and +>= works in this way too.

char is an unsigned 16-bit integer, and is
(as mentioned) thus not affected. There is no
analogue way to handle char data as signed;
rather you may cast char to short for that
effect.

+== and +!= doesn't exists either as equality
operations or uneffected by the signum of the
data.

float and double could also be allowed for
this comparisons, but float and double is neiter
simple bit arrays nor data that changes signum
on overflow.

This addition should be enough, and perhaps
simples and cleanest way, to support both signed
and unsigned integer data types.
