Instead of using 'extends', 'implements ... via ...' can be used.
This does not use class specialisation ('extends'), but forbids
use of it. Between 'implements' and 'via' an interface is added,
while after 'via' and variable, that MAY be 'static' is specified.
This variable must be declared inside the class, and do not need
to be 'final'. More then one 'via' can be used in a classhead, but
they by not share methods (combination of name and parameters), at
all. Using 'via' will add methods to the class and implement it using
the 'using' notation (see 'using methods').
